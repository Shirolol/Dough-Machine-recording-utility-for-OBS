While running
this program will repeatedly press two keys,
set up by the user to start and stop recording at intervals
according to the users preferred length of individual videos.

It will also attempt to delete old videos
that together with the existing videos
exceed the user's preferred total recording length.

Be warned that version 1.0 of this program will assume
that ALL files in the selected directory are videos of the preferred length.

That means that if for instance total length/individual length = 1
the program will, as soon as it enters the state "running",
delete all files but the very newest.
It also means that if there is one file in the directory
and the user manually creates a text file in the directory,
the program will attempt to delete the old file.
And it means that if the preferred video length is changed at runtime,
the program will assume that older videos are of the new preferred length.

To set up hotkeys, simply click the according text field and press the hotkey.
In version 1.0 this will not work with certain keys, usually regional characters.

If an input into one of the fields is not valid,
the field should turn red and the program should enter the error state.

If an input field is cleared,
it should turn yellow and the program should enter the waiting state.
In version 1.0 this behaviour is not entirely consistent.

When all inputs are valid, the program will enter the suspended state.
From there it can be actually started and while running, stopped by pressing the button again.

When an input is changed while the program is running,
it will exit the running state and usually press the hotkey to stop recording.

Verison 1.0 of this program is what the developer,
Serpentyan considers the absolute minimal state,
he would consider "working".
